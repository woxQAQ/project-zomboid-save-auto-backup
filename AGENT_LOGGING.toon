    content: "feat(core-03): Implement core backup logic with garbage collection - CORE-03 completed. Added timestamped backup generation (format: {SaveName}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HH-mm-ss}), automatic GC to remove old backups exceeding retention limit, backup listing and metadata queries, and 6 new Tauri commands. All 48 unit tests passing. Key features: automatic retention policy enforcement, ISO 8601 timestamps, comprehensive backup metadata (size, creation time, paths). Branch: feat/core-03-backup-logic"

    content: "feat(core-04): Implement safe restore logic with undo snapshots - CORE-04 completed. Added automatic undo snapshot creation before restore operations (format: undo_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HH-mm-ss}), restore_backup() command with pre-restore safety, restore_from_undo_snapshot() for rollback capability, list_undo_snapshots() and delete_undo_snapshot() for snapshot management, and 4 new Tauri commands. All 65 unit tests passing. Key implementation details: (1) Undo snapshots stored in {backup_path}/{save_name}_undo/ directory, (2) If current save doesn't exist, restore proceeds without snapshot (first-time restore scenario), (3) If snapshot with same name exists (same timestamp), deleted before creating new one, (4) copy_dir_recursive used for all copy operations (creates destination dir automatically).

    content: "feat(core-05): Implement auto backup background task - CORE-05 completed. Added background timer-based automatic backup with configurable interval (60-86400s default 300s), global singleton AutoBackupManager with RwLock-based state management, per-save auto backup enable/disable with state tracking. 7 new Tauri commands: start_auto_backup, stop_auto_backup, get_auto_backup_status, set_auto_backup_interval, enable_auto_backup, disable_auto_backup, refresh_auto_backup_saves. Implementation uses tokio async runtime with spawn_blocking for sync backup operations. Tracks last_backup_time and next_backup_time per save. Saves must exist before enabling auto backup. Added 13 new unit tests, all 79 tests passing. Added tokio dependency with sync, time, rt-multi-thread, macros features. Branch: feat/core-05-auto-backup-task"

Set up Tailwind CSS v3 for styling, created global CSS with Project Zomboid-inspired dark theme colors (background: #1a1a1a, foreground: #e0e0e0, primary: #d32f2f), created Layout component with Header (includes settings icon with click handler), created Header component with zombie/skull SVG icon and settings button, refactored App.tsx to use new Layout with placeholder dashboard content (getting started checklist), updated Tauri window configuration (productName: 'PZ Backup Tool', window size: 1000x700 with min 800x600, backgroundColor: #1a1a1a). Implementation process: Initially attempted Tailwind CSS v4 but encountered PostCSS plugin compatibility error (It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin - need @tailwindcss/postcss), resolved by downgrading to Tailwind CSS v3 which provides the classic PostCSS plugin approach. Build verified successfully with `pnpm build` and TypeScript types validated with `tsc --noEmit`. Branch: feat/ui-01-frontend-basic-architecture"
